The Goal of this repository is to help host the development of project Genin. A project that aims to create a website where subscribers can download the most recent version of my algorithm trader. Skills/Languages that I'm hoping to learn more of through this project: databases, backend application that interacts with database,  html, css, reactJs, python, sciPy, AWS, and whatever else I'll realize that I need in the next couple weeks
